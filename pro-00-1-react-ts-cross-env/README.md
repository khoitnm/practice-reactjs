# Purpose
In this project, I would like the check what would be generated in `./build/` when applying `cross-env` module.
That `./build/` is the result of `npm run build`

# Environment variables configuration

    - Note 1: "It does not override existing env variables and you canâ€™t force it to do so." \

    - Multiple env files: dotenv recommends NOT using multiple .env files, but it really depends on the deployment approach. 
      Hence, if we need to use multiple `.env` files, here is some guideline: https://github.com/kerimdzhanov/dotenv-flow#files-under-version-control
