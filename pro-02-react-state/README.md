# Getting Started with Create React App
## Intro
In this project, we practice how to manage state (with immutable approach), and trigger function on a component.
The benefits of immutable approach: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#why-immutability-is-important
- Simplify complex features (sometimes, with event-driven and time travelling requirements)
- Detecting changes
- Optimization performance for React to determine should re-render or not (based on detecting changes)

## Development 
This code follows [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#lifting-state-up). <br/>
