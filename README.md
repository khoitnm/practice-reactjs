# Build application

We need to download all dependencies, you can use either npm or yarn (but should not use both).
```
npm install 
```
or
```
yarn install 
``` 

# Start application
```
npm start
```
Then, you should see some URL in the console log like this:
```
Server ready at http://localhost:4000/ 
```
Open that link on the Browser

# Other command lines
- `npm run clean`: remove all `node_modules` from all submodules.
- `npm test`: for testing

     - Start building your app with just pPresentational Components first. 
      If you feel unsure about whether a specific component should be presentational or a container, it might be too early to decide. 
      Donâ€™t sweat it!
